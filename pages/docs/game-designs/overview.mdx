## Range Type

Mech-AI: Battle Arena features three distinct Range Types for weapons, each serving a unique purpose:

- **Short Range**: Intended for close-range attacks, these weapons are designed for confrontations at a proximity where accuracy and precision are key.

    ```
    - min(1)
    - max(2) *only even value
    ```
    


- **Long Range**: These weapons excel at long-range engagements, allowing players to target opponents from a distance, providing strategic advantages.

    ```
    - min(1) 
    - max(1)
    ```


- **Projectile**: This weapon type combines the advantages of long-range attacks with the ability to penetrate obstacles, making it a versatile choice for tactical gameplay.

    ```
    - min(1) 
    - max(2)
    ```

## Stamina Classification

Stamina is a crucial attribute in Mech-AI: Battle Arena, and it varies for each **team**. The following statistics apply:

| Regeneration Per Round | 2  |
| ---------------------- | -- |
| Initial Stamina        | 6  |
| Max Stamina            | 21 |


- **Regeneration Per Round** : Every round, each **team** regenerates 2 stamina points.

- **Initial Stamina** : At the start of a round, each **team** begins with an initial stamina value of 6.

- **Max Stamina** : The maximum stamina a **team** can possess is 21


## Stamina Usage Types

Stamina usage in Mech-AI: Battle Arena falls into two distinct categories:

- **Normal Stamina Usage**: This type of stamina usage implies that the energy expended is directly proportional to the distance covered during actions.

    *Example `min(1)` and `max(5)`*

The energy used is equal as the distance.


- **Reverse Stamina Usage:** Reverse stamina usage is characterized by energy expenditure inversely related to the distance covered. Stamina consumption decreases as distance increases.

    *Example `min(1)` and `max(5)`*

The energy used is reverse from max to min.


These classifications significantly impact the strategic choices players make during battles.
