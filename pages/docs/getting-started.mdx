# Getting Started

To embark on your journey in Mech-AI: Battle Arena development, you'll need to set up your development environment properly.

**Mech-AI : Battle Arena** requires you to have Unity installed in your computer. We use Unity as our game engine and our current version is `2021.3.17f1`. Our game is primarily programmed using C#.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [**Unity**](https://unity.com/download): Mech-AI is developed using Unity, and it's crucial to match the specific version to maintain compatibility. You can download Unity from Unity Hub. Our current version is `2021.3.17f1`.
  

- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or a similar IDE): We recommend using Visual Studio Code as your integrated development environment (IDE). It provides excellent support for C# development. You can download it from Visual Studio Code.


## Repository

We maintain our game's source code on GitHub for collaborative development. You can access the repository by following this [link](https://github.com/gac-research-club/adefagia-dev).

To clone the repository to your local machine, open a terminal or command prompt and use the following command:

```bash copy 
git clone https://github.com/gac-research-club/adefagia-dev.git
```

This will create a local copy of the Mech-AI project on your computer.

Once you have Unity and the Mech-AI project repository ready, follow these steps to open the project in Unity:

1. Launch Unity Hub.

2. Click on the `"Add"` button to add a new project.

3. Browse to the folder where you cloned the Mech-AI repository and select the project folder.

4. Unity Hub will recognize the project, and you can select it from the list. Make sure to choose the correct Unity version (`2021.3.17f1`).
