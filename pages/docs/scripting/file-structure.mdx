## Adefagia 

A subdirectory that appears to be the core directory for your game's assets.

### Arts

This directory contains art-related assets, including subdirectories for materials, textures, fonts, UI elements, 3D models, audio files, videos, skyboxes, and sprites.

#### a. Materials
This directory likely contains material assets that define the visual properties of objects in the game. Materials may include textures, shaders, and other settings that determine how objects appear when rendered.

#### b. Textures
"Textures" is where you store image files, such as textures, images for 3D models, and 2D graphics used throughout the game. Textures are essential for applying visuals to game objects.

#### c. Fonts
The "Fonts" directory is dedicated to fonts and typography assets. Fonts are used to display text and UI elements within the game. This directory may house TrueType Font (TTF) files or bitmap fonts.

#### d. UI
"UI" contains assets used for creating the game's user interface (UI). This includes elements like buttons, menus, HUD components, and any other interactive interface elements.

#### f. Models
The "Models" directory is where you store 3D models and associated assets. These models represent characters, objects, and other elements within the game's 3D environment.

#### g. Audio
In the "Audio" directory, you keep audio assets, including sound effects, background music, voiceovers, and other auditory elements that enhance the gaming experience.

#### h. Video
Video assets, which can be cutscenes, video introductions, or in-game video sequences, are stored in the "Video" directory. This directory is crucial for cinematic storytelling.

#### i. Skybox
Skyboxes are essential for creating the game's background and environmental atmosphere. The "Skybox" directory houses skybox assets, which include cubemaps or spherical images that provide immersive backgrounds.

#### j. Sprite
"Sprite" is dedicated to 2D sprite assets. These assets are commonly used for 2D games or for 2D elements within 3D games. Sprites can include characters, objects, and other flat, image-based game elements.


### Code

Contains script-related assets, including subdirectories for scripts, scriptable objects, shaders, and editor scripts.

#### a. Scripts
This subdirectory, "Scripts," is a central hub for all your game scripts and code files. It includes the C# scripts that control various aspects of gameplay, manage game mechanics, and govern the behavior of in-game elements.

#### b. Scriptable Objects
"Scriptable Objects" is where you store assets that are essentially data containers or objects with customized properties and values. These objects can be used to define various in-game settings, create templates for game objects, and hold data in a structured format.

#### c. Shader
The "Shader" directory contains shader files, which are responsible for defining how objects are rendered visually in the game. Shaders determine the appearance, materials, and visual effects of 3D models and other assets.

#### d. Editor
The "Editor" subdirectory is reserved for custom editor scripts and tools that extend the Unity Editor's functionality. These scripts are used to create custom editors, in-game debug tools, or automation scripts that enhance the development process.


### Scenes

Stores the game's scene files, including MainMenu, Battle, and Splashscreen.

### Prefabs

This directory houses prefab assets, which are pre-configured game objects. It includes subdirectories for general, store, inbox, customization, main menu, splash screen, and battle prefabs.


## Addons 

A directory containing third-party assets or plugins, including DoTween, Flat Icon, Isometric 3D, Mecha, Shift UI, and TextMesh Pro.

## Resources

This directory appears to hold resources in the form of a generalresource.cs file.
